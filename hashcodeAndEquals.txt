
	java.lang.Object
			boolean equals()
			int hashCode()

	Can we override equals and hashCode() method in our class?


	Yes.

	Student s1 = new Student(1,"Raj");
	Student s2 = new Student(1, "Raj");

	

	equals and hashCode must override at same time.

	if you don't every object hash code will be unique generated by java itself.
	collections can't maintain uniqueness.


	equals and hashcode has contract
	
	if two objects are equal both will have same hashcode.
	if two object is having same hashcode object may or may not equal.
